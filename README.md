## SOLUTION

<p>I focused on primodial and primary stages of prevention of 4 diseases which are very common in India. Also the prototype is designed for general public, though i was needed to make the prototype for Sunita Sharma and was asked to identify one use case, but i thought that making it for general and developing it then can result a better solution, if not for now but after it can.</p>

This exercise is prototype of elderly care. It will take user's name,age and height to get register.<br><br>
Once user get register they will get acess of main menu. Now user can use all the features under menu section.The features are: <br><br>

<ol type="1">
	<li><b>Diseases: </b>List of common diseases in India with their proper cure.</li><br>
	<li><b>Weight:</b> It will take the weight as input from user and will decide in which category their weight lies.</li><br>
	<li><b>Blood pressure:</b> It will take the blood pressure value as input from user and will decide in which category their blood pressure lies.</li><br>
	<li><b>TASKLIST:</b> Under this user can create their own task list. This will be useful for elder peoples. It will take task name as input and the time when 
	user want to do that task. User can add task such as 'take medicine 1' and can add time for that task. One can add any number of tasks that they want.
	Initially by default the status of all task will be set as 'not completed'. Once user create the tasklist it will show them some other modifications 
	they can do on their created tasklist. These are as follow:<br><br>
		<ul>
			<li><b>View:</b> It will show user's created tasklist.</li><br>
			<li><b>Update Status:</b> In this user will be able to chage the status of their completed taks.It will take task name as input and mark that task as completed.
			If user input some task name which is not there in your list then it will show 'task is not present in list'.</li><br>
			<li><b>Delete:</b> User can delete particular task just by typing name of the task. If they input some task name which is not there in their list then it will show 
			'task is not present in list'.</li><br>
			<li><b>Clear:</b> User can clear the whole task list and now thir task list will be empty.</li>
		</ul>
	</li><br>
	Now lets comeback to our main menu<br><br>
	<li><b>Profile View:</b> In this, one can see all the information that user have added such as name,age ,weight,height,Blood Pressure,and tasklist.</li><br>
	<li><b>Exit:</b> It will take the user out of main menu with "THANK YOU!" message.</li><br><br>
</ol>
